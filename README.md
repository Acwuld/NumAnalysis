# Numerical analysis experiment class code
The content involves linear equations, nonlinear equations, matrix eigenvalues, interpolation and fitting, differential equations, etc.
#### My ability is very limited, there may be a problem with the code, I hope you can point it out.
#### Also, I'll try to add more languages to implement these algorithms, but I'd appreciate it if you could provide it.
